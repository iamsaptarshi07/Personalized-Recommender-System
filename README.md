Want to know how Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix generate recommendations for their users? In this introductory workshop, we'll learn how to build collaborative filtering and content-based filtering recommender systems using the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset.

We'll be using these packages to do our analysis:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

In this repo, you'll find two notebooks:

1. [notebook](neucf.ipynb): this contains all the codes
2. [tutorial_walkthrough](tutorial_walkthrough.ipynb): fill-in-the-blank notebook (use this one to follow along during the live tutorial)
